    "The compound effects of histological type, age of diagnosis, tumor site, race, gender, etc. on the survival outcome of cancer patients is not fully understood.  \n",

    "<h4>Significance of the Problem</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 40% of humans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lives, hence knowing how severe their diagnosis may turn out would bring a lot of hope to people that may fall under a lower severity bracket while bringing closure to people who may fall under a higher severity bracket. Sometimes not knowing how at risk you are may be more painful than knowing the likely outcome. (https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics)\n",
    "Knowing how at risk patients are based on initial clinical data would allow doctors to prioritize treatments and appointments for high-at-risk patients. While hospitals may have enough space and priority for cancer patients during normal times (which is not always the case even then), this data may be especially useful during times like the covid-19 pandemic. As hospitals were swamped with covid patients many cancer patients missed treatment during this pandemic. Knowing the predicted outcomes may give doctors cause to pull these cancer patients forward in treatment priority.
